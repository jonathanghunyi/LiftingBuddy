# Lifting-Buddy

To run the code use the following commands:

npm install readline
npm install openai
npm install node
npm install body-parser
npm install express
$env:API_KEY='API KEY OBTAINED FROM OPEN AI'
*sometimes $env:API_KEY= does not work and instead need to use the command: export API_KEY='API KEY OBTAINED FROM OPEN AI'

Then to run use the command: node index.js and navigate to http://localhost:3000/
